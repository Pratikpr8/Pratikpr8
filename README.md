# pratik puri :)

Hello! My name is Pratik and I've been learning development.

# About me 
I am absolutly loving development and coding! I'm always working on various topics and projects to improve my skills. I started dev as an interest and ended up getting really invested into it which really helped me to take a decision that I was ready for a career change. Feel free to visit my portfolio site and check out some of the projects that I've been working on.
